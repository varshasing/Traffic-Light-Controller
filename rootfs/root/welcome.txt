Welcome to the EC535 Stock+ Image v1.0!

The stock package includes a working kernel image, rootfs.img, 
and rootfs source directory (in stockplus-rootfs.tar.gz). The rootfs
has been preloaded with a precompiled version of busybox. The 
kernel and the busybox binaries provided in this package were
configured with the goal of balancing size and usability.

Since this is the "plus" stock image, we also include some
additional tools, such as lrzsz for file transfer, and micropython,
a Python interpreter for embedded systems. We've also configured
kernel log messages to go to /var/log/messages (instead of direct
to your console). We hope you find these changes useful!

You may use this stock image for assignments where configuring
the kernel, the rootfs, and/or busybox are NOT part of the main
goals. If you have any questions, please contact your
instructor or a TA.

Have fun!
